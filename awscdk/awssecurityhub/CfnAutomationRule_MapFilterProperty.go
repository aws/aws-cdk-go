package awssecurityhub


// A map filter for filtering AWS Security Hub findings.
//
// Each map filter provides the field to check for, the value to check for, and the comparison operator.
//
// Example:
//   // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
//   // The values are placeholders you should change.
//   import "github.com/aws/aws-cdk-go/awscdk"
//
//   mapFilterProperty := &MapFilterProperty{
//   	Comparison: jsii.String("comparison"),
//   	Key: jsii.String("key"),
//   	Value: jsii.String("value"),
//   }
//
// See: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-securityhub-automationrule-mapfilter.html

type CfnAutomationRule_MapFilterProperty struct {
	// The condition to apply to the key value when filtering Security Hub findings with a map filter.
	//
	// To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
	//
	// - To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department CONTAINS Security` matches findings that include the value `Security` for the `Department` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of `Security team` for the `Department` tag is a match.
	// - To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.
	//
	// `CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that includes either `Security` , `Finance` , or both values.
	//
	// To search for values that don't have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
	//
	// - To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
	// - To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that don’t have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
	//
	// `NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.
	//
	// `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.
	//
	// You can’t have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can’t have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
	//
	// `CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *AWS Security Hub User Guide* .
	// See: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-securityhub-automationrule-mapfilter.html#cfn-securityhub-automationrule-mapfilter-comparison
	//
	Comparison *string `field:"required" json:"comparison" yaml:"comparison"`
	// The key of the map filter.
	//
	// For example, for `ResourceTags` , `Key` identifies the name of the tag. For `UserDefinedFields` , `Key` is the name of the field.
	// See: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-securityhub-automationrule-mapfilter.html#cfn-securityhub-automationrule-mapfilter-key
	//
	Key *string `field:"required" json:"key" yaml:"key"`
	// The value for the key in the map filter.
	//
	// Filter values are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a tag called `Department` might be `Security` . If you provide `security` as the filter value, then there's no match.
	// See: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-securityhub-automationrule-mapfilter.html#cfn-securityhub-automationrule-mapfilter-value

	Value *string `field:"required" json:"value" yaml:"value"`
