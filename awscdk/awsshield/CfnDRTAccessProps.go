	// You can associate only one `RoleArn` with your subscription. If you submit this update for an account that already has an associated role, the new `RoleArn` will replace the existing `RoleArn` .

	// This change requires the following:
	//
	// - You must be subscribed to the [Business Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/) or the [Enterprise Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/) .
	// - The `AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy` managed policy must be attached to the role that you specify in the request. You can access this policy in the IAM console at [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy) . For information, see [Adding and removing IAM identity permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html) .
	// - The role must trust the service principal `drt.shield.amazonaws.com` . For information, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html) .
	//
	// The SRT will have access only to your AWS WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you provide permissions to the SRT to inspect your AWS WAF and Shield configuration and logs, and to create and update AWS WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The SRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you.
