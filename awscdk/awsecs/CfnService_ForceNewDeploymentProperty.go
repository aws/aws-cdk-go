For example, you can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker image with the same image/tag combination ( `my_image:latest` ) or to roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version.

	// The value must be a unique, time- varying value like a timestamp, random string, or sequence number. Use this property when you want to ensure your tasks pick up the latest version of a Docker image that uses the same tag but has been updated in the registry.
