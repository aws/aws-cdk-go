# AWS Region-Specific Information Directory

## Usage

Some information used in CDK Applications differs from one AWS region to
another, such as service principals used in IAM policies, S3 static website
endpoints, ...

### The `RegionInfo` class

The library offers a simple interface to obtain region specific information in
the form of the `RegionInfo` class. This is the preferred way to interact with
the regional information database:

```go
// Get the information for "eu-west-1":
region := regionInfo.RegionInfo_Get(jsii.String("eu-west-1"))

// Access attributes:
region.s3StaticWebsiteEndpoint
```

The `RegionInfo` layer is built on top of the Low-Level API, which is described
below and can be used to register additional data, including user-defined facts
that are not available through the `RegionInfo` interface.

### Low-Level API

This library offers a primitive database of such information so that CDK
constructs can easily access regional information. The `FactName` class provides
a list of known fact names, which can then be used with the `RegionInfo` to
retrieve a particular value:

```go
staticWebsite := regionInfo.Fact_Find(jsii.String("ap-northeast-1"), regionInfo.FactName_S3_STATIC_WEBSITE_ENDPOINT())
```

## Supplying new or missing information

As new regions are released, it might happen that a particular fact you need is
missing from the library. In such cases, the `Fact.register` method can be used
to inject FactName into the database:

```go
type myFact struct {
	region
	name
	value
}

regionInfo.Fact_Register(NewMyFact())
```

## Overriding incorrect information

In the event information provided by the library is incorrect, it can be
overridden using the same `Fact.register` method demonstrated above, simply
adding an extra boolean argument:

```go
type myFact struct {
	region
	name
	value
}

regionInfo.Fact_Register(NewMyFact(), jsii.Boolean(true))
```

If you happen to have stumbled upon incorrect data built into this library, it
is always a good idea to report your findings in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues), so we can fix
it for everyone else!
