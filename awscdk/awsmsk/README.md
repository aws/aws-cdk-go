There are no official hand-written ([L2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib)) constructs for this service yet. Here are some suggestions on how to proceed:

* Search [Construct Hub for MSK construct libraries](https://constructs.dev/search?q=msk)
* Use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, in the same way you would use [the CloudFormation AWS::MSK resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_MSK.html) directly.

> An experimental construct library for this service is available in preview. Since it is not stable yet, it is distributed
> as a separate package so that you can pin its version independently of the rest of the CDK. See the package:

> <span class="package-reference">@aws-cdk/aws-msk-alpha</span>

(Read the [CDK Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this construct library.)
