package awssagemaker


// Configures conditions under which the processing job should be stopped, such as how long the processing job has been running.
//
// After the condition is met, the processing job is stopped.
//
// Example:
//   // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
//   // The values are placeholders you should change.

type CfnProcessingJob_StoppingConditionProperty struct {
	// The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a training or compilation job can run before it is stopped.
	//
	// For compilation jobs, if the job does not complete during this time, a `TimeOut` error is generated. We recommend starting with 900 seconds and increasing as necessary based on your model.
	//
	// For all other jobs, if the job does not complete during this time, SageMaker ends the job. When `RetryStrategy` is specified in the job request, `MaxRuntimeInSeconds` specifies the maximum time for all of the attempts in total, not each individual attempt. The default value is 1 day. The maximum value is 28 days.
	//
	// The maximum time that a `TrainingJob` can run in total, including any time spent publishing metrics or archiving and uploading models after it has been stopped, is 30 days.
