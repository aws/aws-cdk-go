// The order that compute environments are tried in for job placement within a queue.
//
// Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the `VALID` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 ( `EC2` or `SPOT` ) or Fargate ( `FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT` ); Amazon EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
//
// > All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.
//
// Example:
//   // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
//   // The values are placeholders you should change.
